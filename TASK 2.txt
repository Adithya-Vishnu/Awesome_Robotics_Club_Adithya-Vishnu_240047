The project I have chosen as my top priority is the hexapod. The reason I am interested by it is because it is different from the normal mainstream projects which always includes wheels. Another reason I am intrigues is because this has a lot of scope for development like adding another set of servo motors to also allow the bot to get raised and be able to bow on saying some command sit and stuff.
